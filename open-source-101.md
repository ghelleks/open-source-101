# Four Freedoms #

## Free to use. ##
Anyone can use it, however they like.

## Free to copy. ##
Anyone can get a copy for the cost of media.

## Free to modify. ##
If I don’t like how it works, I can change it.

## Free to distribute. ##
I can share my changes.

---
# GNU Public License #

## Implements the four freedoms. ##
Use, copy, modify, distribute.

## Built on copyright. ##
The author provides additional rights for additional responsibilities.

## In some cases, problematic. ##
But more on that later.

    I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and 
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing 
    since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on 
    things people like/dislike in minix...
